# Prison Break
(not the show)

![Designer (9)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a307e5b-549d-4532-af4d-38f94fe02181)

This project explores prison breaks with an intent to learn the following:
- Obtaining real data from the internet and preparing it for analysis
- Analyzing the data using Python

Specifically, we'll answer the following questions:
- In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempts occur?
- In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison breaks occur?

We'll use Python to create a frequency table showing our results. As seen in the table below, France leads with the highest number of attempted helicopter prison breaks:

| Country | Number of Occurrences |
| --- | --- |
| France | 15 |
| United States	| 8 |
| Belgium | 4 |
| Canada | 4 |
| Greece | 4 |
| Australia | 2 |
| Brazil | 2 |
| United Kingdom | 2 |
| Mexico | 1 |
| Ireland | 1 |
| Italy | 1 |
| Puerto Rico | 1 |
| Chile	| 1 |
| Netherlands | 1 |
| Russia | 1 |

As mentioned earlier, this project works with real-life data and we get it straight from a frequently updated [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes#Actual_attempts).

`helper.py` is a module containing useful "helper" functions that we'll need for this project. Let's get into it.
